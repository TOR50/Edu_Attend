2.  **Phase 2: UI/UX Overhaul (Frontend & Design)**
    *   Once the backend is robust, we'll apply a consistent, professional, and mobile-friendly design across the entire application.
### **4. Drastic UI/UX Improvement (Apple-Inspired Design)**

**The Problem:** The current UI is a generic Bootstrap layout. It's not memorable, visually appealing, or optimized for mobile.

**Proposed Solution & Reasoning:**

To achieve that clean, premium, Apple-inspired look, we'll focus on **simplicity, consistency, and typography.**

*   **Color Palette**: We'll adopt a professional and clean color scheme.
    *   **Background**: A slightly off-white (`#F9F9F9`) or light gray.
    *   **Text**: A dark, near-black charcoal (`#333333`) for high readability.
    *   **Primary Accent**: A vibrant, accessible blue (`#007AFF`) for buttons, links, and important actions.
    *   **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for borders, cards, and secondary text.
*   **Layout & Consistency**:
    *   **Mobile-First**: The entire interface will be designed to work beautifully on a phone first, then scale up to a desktop.
    *   **New Navigation**: A clean, persistent sidebar for navigation on desktop, which collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile.
    *   **Card-Based Design**: We'll replace simple lists with modern "cards" that have rounded corners and subtle shadows. This will be used for displaying classes, students, etc.
*   **Typography**: We will use a clean, sans-serif font stack that renders beautifully on all devices, with larger font sizes and more generous spacing to improve readability.
